#You are given an array complexity of length n.
#There are n locked computers in a room with labels from 0 to n - 1, 
# each with its own unique password. The password of the computer i has a complexity complexity[i].
#The password for the computer labeled 0 is already decrypted and serves as the root.
#  All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:
#You can decrypt the password for the computer i using the password for computer j,
#  where j is any integer less than i with a lower complexity. (i.e. j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i])
#To decrypt the password for computer i, you must have already unlocked a computer j such that j < i 
# and complexity[j] < complexity[i].
#Find the number of permutations of [0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)] that represent a valid order 
# in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.
